# My-Grandsons

This whatsApp client saves photos and videos from all the family whatsapp groups and present them in the most simple and straightforward way.
It designed for connecting your grandparents (or just your technophobes parents) to your family groups so they could see the pictures and the videos but will not see 
all the chatting stuff. 
The app is so simple that even your 90 grandma could manage it- she just need to open the app (grandson can do it for her) and swipe through the family photos.
The only problem is that gramme don't have a smart phone, so grandson need to buy her an android phone and make sure to ask the password for the wifi network from
her neighbors. 


Instructions: 
For the moment there isn't any build apk, you need to build it yourself. 
After building and installing you will see the registration page. you need to register the phone just like a regular whatsApp. you can use your grandma phone number even if she 
doesn't have smart phone, you just need to receive the verification code. don't use your own number because it will roll you out from your regular whatsapp client! 
after registering the phone, you need to add your grandma as a regular whatsapp member to all your family groups and you are ready to go...she will receive only photos and videos that you send in the groups (or personally). 
 
 
sending a postcard to your grandparents:
if you write a message in your family group that start with "##", your grandparents will receive it as a postcard. 
for example:
"## Hello grandma! I am having a great time in Mexico! miss you a lot, B.Obama" 
and the postcard on the grandma phone:
